# Bill-Tracker
This is a Bill Tracker app where users can store bills with amounts and dates. Perhaps down the line I will add an urgency feature for listed bills. It's built using the MERN Stack which consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS + Bootstrap &amp; ChartJS. 

In order to run the Client server whilst in a terminal within the root folder type in cd bill-tracker && npm start.

To run the Back-End server whilst in a terminal within the root folder type in npm run server.
